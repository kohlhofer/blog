John Hill has put together [a remarkable overview][1] of housing patterns in the US. It strikes me how very different these are from the much more organically grown communities I am used to in Europe. 

Very few if any are walkable.

Finding an real community to live in rather than a place to just park your car at night is not as easy as is should be.

Side note: Gated communities appear to be the ultimate in reality denial and disconnect. At least they keep the people on the outside safe from the people who choose that life style.
