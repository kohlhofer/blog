The liberal bias of the media as lamented by conservative pundits is a curious thing. I have some difficulty detecting it but then I am liberally biased myself.

Back when the patriot act made sweeping changes to fundamental rights I was shocked. But more so by the near total silence of the domestic press on the left and right. 

The repercussions of this failure to report and opose are still with us today.

Defending your freedoms by sacrificing those very freedoms did not make any sense. And it still does not. Yet here we are today: drone strikes, people detained for years without due process. Secretive military trials and torture. The latter might have come to an end but we will never know for sure without proper investigation.

President Obama was not challenged on any of this during his re-election, though. These fundamentally unconstitutional issues are not called out nearly enough. When they are it is by the "liberally biased" main stream media and not by the opposition which instead focuses on birth certificates, out of context quotes and other fabrications.

Does "liberal bias" in fact mean objective and fact based reporting? If so please give me some more because there is not nearly enough of it.
