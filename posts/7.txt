A Twitter conversation:

[@kohlhofer][1]: 
> Good morning

[@red56][2]: 
> [@kohlhofer][1] Good morning, even though I'm just replying to a robot (is this some kind of psychological experiment?)

[@walski][3]:
> He promised me it's not!

[@kohlhofer][1]:
> I am just trying to brighten everybody's dayâ€“every day!

[@red56][2]:
> I need to know that there's a human behind for my day to be brightened

[@kohlhofer][1]:
> Well there is me  :)

[@red56][2]: 
> only if your intention is behind each tweet!

[@red56][2]: 
> hmm, though... is programming a tweetbot different from being socially conditioned (self-programmed) to say good morning

[@walski][3]:
> I'm signing out, that is getting too philosophical wayyy to quickly ;)

[@paulharter][4]:
> admirable consistency

[@paulharter][4]:
> maybe A could send himself a monthly opt-out to top up intention?

[@kohlhofer][1]:
> That implies that this is automatic. Which it is of course not.
