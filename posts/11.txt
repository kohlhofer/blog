[Downton Abbey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downton_Abbey) opens to the hustle and bustle of the big house being prepared for another day. Countless serving folks busy getting everything in order only to disappear into the servants' quarters before the masters wake up.

This world is thankfully long gone (I know that is sad but only because you are picturing yourself as the lord. In reality you would have been the kitchen maid. So stop it!) 

Today I was reminded of this when visiting our new house. *Abbey Lane* (yes that is the street's name) was busy this morning. A whole team of workers with several trucks were getting ready to remove a number of trees and other workers had just arrived to patch up the ceiling in the house. Quite some hustle and bustle to get the small house ready for us.

We are hoping to move in by the end of February and there are a great many pople involved making that happen. Still not feeling very lordly, though.
